OBJECTIVE:
To design a mobile based application which will enable the clients to choose from the stocks which are deemed “safe” for them. Hence, maximize their return chances.


BASIC EXPLANATION OF THE PROJECT: 

An application to maintain a financial profile of the client, his salary - tax deposits - insurance. 
Thereafter, the application could give him stock options based on his age - salary - market condition - (analyzing how much risk he could take). 

A user has his profile made in the app, he enters all his relevant financial details, the app decides how much risks the client can take . The app then classifies the rss feed from BSE and NSE, and displays them. The client should be comfortable in investing those companies. The stocks will be marked as “safe”, “moderate” or “risky” for the client. 

AVENUES FOR FURTHER RESEARCH:

Further, the application could be expanded to use Data Mining and 
Machine learning to predict stock prices based on historical data.
A possible range for the stock price could be generated using historical data
of the stock’s previous performances.

APPLICATION: 

Any investor in the market will be able to make efficient buys, with possibly higher returns.
Investment-Income ratio will increase, as people will invest more. Earlier they didn’t know which shares they could invest in depending on their salary.
Jargons of the Stock market will be far removed, hence, attracting investments. People will care for their interest, and that’s what will be displayed in the app.
